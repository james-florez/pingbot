# PINGBOT
UCLA Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone Project


This project was completed in 2019 during my senior year at UCLA with a team of 6 other mechanical engineers. We were given the task of designing and building an autonomous robot to solve a unique problem.


Pingbot was designed to help less-mobile senior citizens play ping-pong. Our robot needed to autonomously find ping-pong balls on the ground, collect and store them, navigate to a designated serving position, and then present a ball to be served. The key feature of the design was using a fan to suck up balls from the floor, transfer them to a storage area above the fan, and then levitate them on a stream of air to serving height.


Pingbot was controlled by an Arduino and the operating program is hosted on this repository. 


After many late nights troubleshooting our design Pingbot worked as intended. On presentation day we had the only successful live demo out of 5 teams and were commended by our professor for Pingbot's performance.
